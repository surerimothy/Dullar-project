        <p> <img src="images/visit/visit1.jpg"> Express Entry is an online immigration system which manages skilled workers applications for permanent residence to Canada under federal and certain provincial economic programs. It is not an immigration program in itself, but a method for selecting the best candidates for Canada’s existing skilled worker immigration programs.</p>
       
        <p> <img src="images/visit/visit2.jpeg"> Express Entry is a simplified, fast and efficient immigration selection system offering permanent residence in 6-months to qualified skilled workers.</p>
      
        <p> <img src="images/visit/visit3.jpeg"> Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage Canadian permanent residence applications for filling labour gaps through certain economic immigration programs.Launched on 1 January 2015, this immigration system is used to select and communicate with skilled and qualified applicants, it also manages a pool of immigration ready skilled workers. Express Entry is designed to facilitate express immigration of skilled workers to Canada "who are most likely to succeed economically. The system is identified to be efficient in processing times, with 80% of applications processed in 6 months or less compared to an existing one. </p>

        <p> <img src="images/visit/visit4.jpeg">  Those who are eligible for one of the programs managed by Express Entry submit their application and the Canadian government issues invitation letters to successful candidates per a score system. Acceptance of the invitation and positive assessment of the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada on the application will grant the applicant, and their accompanying family members, Canadian permanent resident status. </p>

        <p><img src="images/visit/visit5.jpeg"> Express Entry replaced the original "first-come first-served" immigration selection system. Express Entry was expected to be more responsive to regional labour shortages. It systemically favours qualified immigrants by prioritising such individuals and avoids the arbitrary selections of the previous system which, in some cases, were based on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

        <p> <img src="images/visit/visit6.jpeg">  Express Entry uses a points-based system, called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to automatically rank interested candidates and select the most competitive for immigration. The core factors considered are age, level of education, language proficiency in English and/or French, and Canadian work experience. An ideal candidate would be between the age of 20–29, possessing a high level of education, and advanced proficiency in either English or French.</p>
